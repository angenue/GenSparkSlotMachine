# GenSparkSlotMachine

The "Simple Slot Machine" game is a basic simulation of a slot machine, where players can spin the reels and potentially win based on the combination of symbols that align on the machine's display. This Java project aims to create an engaging and interactive slot machine experience. Players will interact with the game by initiating spins, and their outcomes will depend on the random generation of symbols on the reels.
